Jukebot
=======

Jukebot is an IRC bot (actually an [rbot](http://ruby-rbot.org/) plugin) for controlling iTunes. It allows users connected to the same IRC server to give commands for controlling playback of music in the iTunes app.

## Requirements

[RubyOSA](http://rubyosa.rubyforge.org/install.html) and [rbot](http://ruby-rbot.org/rbot-trac/wiki/MacOsX).

## Features

* It can control iTunes either on the same system the bot is running on, or a machine on the same network (by adding :machine=>'foo.local', :username => 'foo', :password => 'bar' parameters to the OSA.app('iTunes') call).
* Various undocumented and probably useless commands (see `jukebot.rb`).

## Bugs

* Since itâ€™s used on an internal server, it has no access control. So it responds to messages from anyone (even if they are not in the same channel as the bot).
* The source is the result of 10 minute bursts of coding whenever we wanted a new feature, so the codebase is not the best and could do with some cleaning up.
